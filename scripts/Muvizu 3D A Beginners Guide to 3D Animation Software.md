## What is Muvizu 3D?
 
Muvizu 3D is a 3D animation software developed by Digimania, a company based in Glasgow, Scotland. It was launched in 2010 as a beta version and has since been updated with new features and improvements. Muvizu 3D is designed to be easy and intuitive for beginners who want to make 3D animations for fun, education, or business purposes.
 
Muvizu 3D uses a drag-and-drop interface that lets you create and edit your animations in real time. You can select from a library of pre-made characters, props, scenes, and effects, or import your own assets. You can then customize the appearance, movement, and behavior of your elements using simple tools and sliders. You can also record your own voice or use text-to-speech to make your characters talk. You can add music and sound effects from the software or import your own files.
 
Once you are happy with your animation, you can export it as a video file or upload it directly to YouTube or Facebook. You can also share your animation with other Muvizu 3D users on the official website or join the online community to get feedback and tips.
  
## How does Muvizu 3D work?
 
To start using Muvizu 3D, you need to download and install the software on your computer. The software is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10. You also need a graphics card that supports DirectX 9.0c or higher.
 
Once you launch the software, you will see a welcome screen that gives you the option to create a new project, open an existing project, or watch some tutorials. If you choose to create a new project, you will be taken to the main workspace where you can start making your animation.
 
The main workspace consists of four panels: the viewport, the timeline, the properties panel, and the content library. The viewport is where you can see your animation as you create it. You can zoom in and out, rotate, and pan the viewport using your mouse or keyboard shortcuts. The timeline is where you can control the timing and sequence of your animation. You can add keyframes, edit transitions, and adjust the duration of each element. The properties panel is where you can modify the attributes of your elements such as color, size, position, rotation, etc. The content library is where you can access the pre-made assets or import your own files.
 
To create an animation with Muvizu 3D, you need to follow these basic steps:
 
1. Select a scene from the content library or create your own scene using the scene editor.
2. Add characters and props from the content library or import your own models.
3. Customize the appearance and movement of your characters and props using the properties panel.
4. Add dialogue to your characters using the dialogue editor. You can record your own voice or use text-to-speech.
5. Add music and sound effects from the content library or import your own files.
6. Add effects such as lights, shadows, fog, fire, etc. from the content library or create your own effects using the effect editor.
7. Preview your animation in the viewport and adjust the timing and sequence of your elements using the timeline.
8. Export your animation as a video file or upload it directly to YouTube or Facebook.
